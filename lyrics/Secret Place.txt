Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the secret place

Where will you run my soul
Where will you go when wells run dry
When the wind starts to blow
How are you gonna keep this flame alive

In the fading light when night is breaking
I know You will always be waiting
You'll always be there

I'm running to the secret place
Where You are, where You are
I'll sing to You of all the ways
You stole my heart, stole my heart
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the secret place

You are my only hope
You are the rock on which I stand
And You will not let me go
I know that I'm safe inside Your hands

In the fading light when night is breaking
I know You will always be waiting
You'll always be there

I'm running to the secret place
Where You are, where You are
I'll sing to You of all the ways
You stole my heart, stole my heart
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the secret place

Hands are lifted high, hearts awake to life
We are satisfied here with You, here with You
Chains will hit the floor, broken lives restored
We couldn't ask for more here with You, here with You

Hands are lifted high, hearts awake to life
We are satisfied here with You, here with You
Chains will hit the floor, broken lives restored
We couldn't ask for more here with You, here with You

I'm running to the secret place
Where You are, where You are
I'll sing to You of all the ways
You stole my heart, stole my heart
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the secret place
